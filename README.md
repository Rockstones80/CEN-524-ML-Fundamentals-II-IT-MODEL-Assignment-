# Web Dev Project Time Prediction by Uzor Samuel 20CN027849

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict project completion time based on:

- Number of frontend components (synthetic data)
- Number of backend APIs (realistic simulated data)

## Files

- `synthetic_webdev_dataset.csv`: Simulated dataset based on frontend components
- `real_webdev_dataset.csv`: Simulated dataset for backend APIs
- `model.py`: Python script to train and evaluate a linear regression model
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the model:
   ```
   python model.py
   ```

This project is based on experience as a web developer during an industrial training program.
